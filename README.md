# blue-harvest

After completeing the boot.dev course on writing 'asteroids' in python, I struck inspiration. Using that knowledge, I'm going to write this game. I'm calling it blue harvest, because I have no idea what else to call it (and.. duh). The inspiration for what this will become was some old helicopter rail shooter thing I played years ago. I swear the word "blackhawk" was in the title, but I do not remember.

# Executable for windows
I literally have no idea if I did this right, and I don't currently have a windows pc to access. But I'm building an executable anyway. It'll be in the dist/ directory. Let me know if it works, or not idc.

## Controls
W,A,S,D or Arrow keys--> Movement<br>
Space --> Shoot<br>
Escape --> Pause<br>
<br>
I've had some issues that could be caused by forcing a simple restart when applying settings. Until then, here are some keybinds<br>
Enter --> Apply<br>
Escape --> Main menu<br>
<br>
From the main menu<br>
Escape --> Exit<br>

## Chores
Still so much to do.
- Need comments. All the comments
- Game state UI (Basic implementation done)
- Figure out why tf it's lagging. Seriously, I don't even know how I did this (Don't do dumb stuff. Fixed)
- Implement scoring system that is not just +10 points per kill
- Implement a method for spawning different *types* of enemies
- Implement powerups
- Implement Bosses
- Learn and Implement save/load functionality
