# blue-harvest

After completeing the boot.dev course on writing 'asteroids' in python, I struck inspiration. Using that knowledge, I'm going to write this game. I'm calling it blue harvest, because I have no idea what else to call it (and.. duh). The inspiration for what this will become was some old helicopter rail shooter thing I played years ago. I swear the word "blackhawk" was in the title, but I do not remember.<br>
I have not completed the entire boot.dev course library (I got to the asteroids clone) and decide "I got this. I have a vision and I'm going to make it. If I don't know it, I'll learn it as I go". So far, I'm happy with what this mentality has produced.<br>
This is a "weekend project" for me. I work full time and have a 4 year old at home. I get 2 days off each week, Might as well "work" through them.<br>
I look forward to seeing how far I go with this.

# Executable for windows
I literally have no idea if I did this right, and I don't currently have a windows pc to access. But I'm building an executable anyway. It'll be in the dist/ directory. Let me know if it works, or not idc.

## Controls
W,A,S,D or Arrow keys--> Movement<br>
Space --> Shoot<br>
Escape --> Pause<br>
<br>
I've had some issues that could be fixed by forcing a simple restart when applying settings. Until then, here are some keybinds<br>
Enter --> Apply<br>
Escape --> Main menu<br>
<br>
From the main menu<br>
Escape --> Exit<br>

## Chores
Still so much to do.
- Need comments. All the comments
- FIXED Game state UI (Basic implementation done)
- FIXED Figure out why tf it's lagging. Seriously, I don't even know how I did this (Don't do dumb stuff. Fixed)
- Implement scoring system that is not just +10 points per kill
- Implement a method for spawning different *types* of enemies
- Implement powerups
- Implement Bosses
- ADDED Learn and Implement save/load functionality (In the form of a leaderboard)
- Change leaderboard (needs max size and overwrite)
