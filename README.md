# blue-harvest

After completeing the boot.dev course on writing 'asteroids' in python, I struck inspiration. Using that knowledge, I'm going to write this game. I'm calling it blue harvest, because I have no idea what else to call it (and.. duh). The inspiration for what this will become was some old helicopter rail shooter thing I played years ago. I swear the word "blackhawk" was in the title, but I do not remember.

# Executable for windows
I literally have no idea if I did this right, and I don't currently have a windows pc to access. But I'm building an executable anyway. It'll be in the dist/ directory. Let me know if it works, or not idc.

## Controls
W,A,S,D --> Movement
Space --> Shoot
F1 --> Spawn enemy
Escape --> Main menu

I've had some issues that could be caused by forcing a simple restart when applying settings. Until then, here are some keybinds
Enter --> Apply
Escape --> Main menu

From the main menu
Escape --> Exit

## Chores
Still so much to do.
- Need comments. All the comments
- Game state UI
- Figure out why tf it's lagging. Seriously, I don't even know how I did this
