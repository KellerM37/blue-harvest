# blue-harvest

After completeing the boot.dev course on writing 'asteroids' in python, I struck inspiration. Using that knowledge, I'm going to write this game. I'm calling it blue harvest, because I have no idea what else to call it (and.. duh). The inspiration for what this will become was some old helicopter rail shooter thing I played years ago. I swear the word "blackhawk" was in the title, but I do not remember.
